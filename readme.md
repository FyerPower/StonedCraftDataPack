# StonedCraft Custom Data Pack

Custom Datapack designed specifically for StonedCraft SMP Servers

## Installation

Excerpt from Minecraft Wiki:

> Data packs can be placed in the .minecraft/saves/(world)/datapacks folder of a world. Each data pack is either a sub-folder or a .zip file within the datapacks folder. After it is in the folder, a data pack is enabled for that world when the world is reloaded or loaded.
